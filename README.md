D2 : Completed lesson 5.1 to 5.5
     Continuing Neural Networks and deep learning by Andrew Ng
     
D3 : Solved problems on Hackerrank in python section

D4 : Vectorisation and linear regression code
     
D5 : Build image recognition algorithm on cat vs non-cat datasets

     1. Worked with Logistic Regression
     2. Learned to minimise the cost function
     3. Learned how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters

D6 : Solved problems on hackerrank in python

D7 : Completed the course of Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Andrew Ng

D8 : Completed the notebook to generate red and blue points to form a flower.

     1. Developed an intuition of back-propagation and saw it working on data.
     2. Built all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

D9 : Completed part 5.6 to 5.8

D10 : Continued lesson 5.9 to 5.11

D11 : Continued lesson 5.12 to 5.15

D12 : Started building a deep neural network

D13 : Completed and compiled the functions for the finalised model
      
      1.Developed an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
      2.Wrote functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help decompose code and ease       the process of building a neural network
      3.Initialized/updated parameters according to your desired structure.

D14 : Deep Neural Network : Application

      1.Learned how to use all the helper functions built previously to build a model.
      2.Experimented with different model architectures and saw how each one behaves.
